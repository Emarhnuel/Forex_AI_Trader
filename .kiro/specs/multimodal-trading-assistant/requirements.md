# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Multimodal AI Trading Assistant is a full-stack application that provides traders with AI-driven analysis of their trading charts through video uploads. The system combines a React frontend with a Python backend powered by CrewAI to deliver comprehensive trading strategy recommendations through a multi-agent workflow that analyzes charts, gathers real-time data, and formulates actionable trading strategies.

## Requirements

3. WHEN a video upload is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide real-time upload progress feedback
4. WHEN a video upload completes THEN the system SHALL trigger the multi-agent analysis workflow
5. IF a video upload fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the agent SHALL output structured data containing all identified elements
6. IF the chart cannot be clearly identified THEN the system SHALL request clarification from the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to gather real-time market data for my identified trading pair, so that the strategy recommendations are based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the trading pair is identified THEN the Financial Data Agent SHALL fetch current price data
2. WHEN gathering data THEN the agent SHALL retrieve volume information for the trading pair
3. WHEN gathering data THEN the agent SHALL collect order book data when available
4. WHEN data collection is complete THEN the agent SHALL provide timestamped market data
5. IF API data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use alternative data sources or notify the user
6. WHEN data is older than 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL refresh the data automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to receive a comprehensive trading strategy with specific entry points, stop-loss, and take-profit levels, so that I can make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chart analysis and market data are available THEN the Strategy Agent SHALL synthesize the information
2. WHEN formulating strategy THEN the agent SHALL provide specific entry price recommendations
3. WHEN formulating strategy THEN the agent SHALL calculate appropriate stop-loss levels
4. WHEN formulating strategy THEN the agent SHALL suggest take-profit targets
5. WHEN strategy is complete THEN the agent SHALL include risk assessment and position sizing recommendations
6. WHEN strategy conflicts with market conditions THEN the agent SHALL provide alternative approaches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to interact with the AI through continuous voice conversation using LiveKit, so that I can have natural, real-time discussions about trading strategies without pressing buttons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice mode is activated THEN the system SHALL continuously listen for user speech using Voice Activity Detection

4. WHEN in voice mode THEN the system SHALL allow seamless back-and-forth conversation without manual controls
5. WHEN voice mode is toggled off THEN the system SHALL stop continuous listening and return to text mode
6. IF audio feedback or noise occurs THEN the system SHALL handle echo cancellation and noise suppression

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a clean and intuitive web interface, so that I can easily upload videos, view analysis results, and interact with the AI assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL use FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL handle multiple concurrent video analyses
3. WHEN agents are working THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling and logging
4. WHEN integrating with external APIs THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and retry logic
5. IF an agent fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and notify the user
6. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments

### Requirement 8
